      "As a program evolves and acquires more features, it becomes complicated, with subtle dependencies between components.
      Over time, complexity accumulates, and it becomes harder and harder for programmers to keep all the relevant factors in their minds as they modify the system.
      This slows down development and leads to bugs, which slow development even more and add to its cost. Complexity increases inevitably over the life of any program.
      The larger the program, and the more people that work on it, the more diﬃcult it is to manage complexity." – John Ousterhout
      This class teaches you how to engineer production-level software in Go leveraging the power of a domain-driven, data-oriented architecture that can run in Kubernetes.
      From the beginning, you will program along with the instructor as he walks through the design philosophies and guidelines for engineering software in Go.
      With each new feature added to the project, you will learn how to think about, read, maintain, manage, and debug code.
      The core of this class is to teach you how to handle and reduce the spread of complexity in the systems you are building.
