      "As a program evolves and acquires more features, it becomes complicated, with subtle dependencies between components.
      Over time, complexity accumulates, and it becomes harder and harder for programmers to keep all the relevant factors in their minds as they modify the system.
      This slows down development and leads to bugs, which slow development even more and add to its cost. Complexity increases inevitably over the life of any program.
      The larger the program, and the more people that work on it, the more diﬃcult it is to manage complexity." – John Ousterhout
      This class teaches you how to engineer production-level software in Go leveraging the power of a domain-driven, data-oriented architecture that can run in Kubernetes.
      From the beginning, you will program along with the instructor as he walks through the design philosophies and guidelines for engineering software in Go.
      With each new feature added to the project, you will learn how to think about, read, maintain, manage, and debug code.
      The core of this class is to teach you how to handle and reduce the spread of complexity in the systems you are building.

      Don't know what a linter is? Have you ever heard of a linter without really understanding its purpose? 
      Do you already use a linter on a daily basis, but would like to go one step further by customizing it to your needs? Then this talk is for you!
  
      In this session, we'll demystify the concept of linter, explaining its fundamental role in improving code quality and automating best practices. 
      We'll explore the basics of how they work, before getting down to the nitty-gritty of building a customized linter, step by step. 
      At the end of the session, you'll leave with the knowledge and tools you need to create and share your own linter, tailored to your team or the open source community.
  
      Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, come and discover how a well-designed linter can transform the way you code!
  
      We'll be using the Go language for our examples, but we'll also be opening the door to tooling for other programming languages.

      In this talk, we will explore how runtime tracing works in the Go runtime and how we can use it to understand the runtime behaviour of Go programs.
      The first part of the talk is dedicated to the history of runtime tracing in Go, recording traces and what information the traces contain.
      Then we will take a look at tools that you can use to explore the contents of the traces and how to use them to get insights from the data.
      After this talk, you will have an overview of runtime tracing in Go, so that you can start exploring the behavior of your own programs.

Let’s take a look at how testcontainers can help us writing tests requiring more complicated setup. We’ll go through integration testing external services and databases and test performance tuning.

    description: |
      The presentation will provide an in-depth exploration of memory scavenging in Go, focusing on its critical role within the garbage collection (GC) system.
      We will examine the purpose of memory scavenging, how it helps in efficiently reclaiming heap memory, and the optimization techniques employed by Go’s garbage collector to balance memory usage.
      Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of Go's memory management and how scavenging plays a vital role in optimizing memory retention and system performance.

      Writing complex shell scripts is hard, running python script anywhere is also hard.
      The ultimate solution for custom tooling is Go. We use custom CLI tools written in Go by ourself and with our clients.
      I'll show you how to write own CLI util and how to easily distribute it across all the platforms (Mac, Linux, Windows).

      This talk offers a guided tour through the internals of the Go compiler, exploring how Go code is transformed into machine code.
      While not diving too deep into any one area, we'll touch on key components, design decisions, and interesting behaviors developers might not be aware of.
      Whether you're a language nerd or just curious how your code comes to life, there's something here for you. No prior compiler knowledge required.
