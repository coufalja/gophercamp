      "As a program evolves and acquires more features, it becomes complicated, with subtle dependencies between components.
      Over time, complexity accumulates, and it becomes harder and harder for programmers to keep all the relevant factors in their minds as they modify the system.
      This slows down development and leads to bugs, which slow development even more and add to its cost. Complexity increases inevitably over the life of any program.
      The larger the program, and the more people that work on it, the more diﬃcult it is to manage complexity." – John Ousterhout
      This class teaches you how to engineer production-level software in Go leveraging the power of a domain-driven, data-oriented architecture that can run in Kubernetes.
      From the beginning, you will program along with the instructor as he walks through the design philosophies and guidelines for engineering software in Go.
      With each new feature added to the project, you will learn how to think about, read, maintain, manage, and debug code.
      The core of this class is to teach you how to handle and reduce the spread of complexity in the systems you are building.

      Don't know what a linter is? Have you ever heard of a linter without really understanding its purpose? 
      Do you already use a linter on a daily basis, but would like to go one step further by customizing it to your needs? Then this talk is for you!
  
      In this session, we'll demystify the concept of linter, explaining its fundamental role in improving code quality and automating best practices. 
      We'll explore the basics of how they work, before getting down to the nitty-gritty of building a customized linter, step by step. 
      At the end of the session, you'll leave with the knowledge and tools you need to create and share your own linter, tailored to your team or the open source community.
  
      Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, come and discover how a well-designed linter can transform the way you code!
  
      We'll be using the Go language for our examples, but we'll also be opening the door to tooling for other programming languages.
