**Memory scavenging in Go**  
*The presentation will provide an in-depth exploration of memory scavenging in Go, focusing on its critical role within the garbage collection (GC) system.  
We will examine the purpose of memory scavenging, how it helps in efficiently reclaiming heap memory, and the optimization techniques employed by Go’s garbage collector to balance memory usage.  
Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of Go's memory management and how scavenging plays a vital role in optimizing memory retention and system performance.*

## 14:00 - 15:00
**Your code deserves better: give it a linter!**  
*Don't know what a linter is? Have you ever heard of a linter without really understanding its purpose?  
Do you already use a linter on a daily basis, but would like to go one step further by customizing it to your needs? Then this talk is for you!  
In this session, we'll demystify the concept of linter, explaining its fundamental role in improving code quality and automating best practices.  
We'll explore the basics of how they work, before getting down to the nitty-gritty of building a customized linter, step by step.  
At the end of the session, you'll leave with the knowledge and tools you need to create and share your own linter, tailored to your team or the open source community.*

**Understanding runtime traces**  
*In this talk, we will explore how runtime tracing works in the Go runtime and how we can use it to understand the runtime behavior of Go programs.  
The first part of the talk is dedicated to the history of runtime tracing in Go, recording traces, and what information the traces contain.  
Then we will take a look at tools that you can use to explore the contents of the traces and how to use them to get insights from the data.  
After this talk, you will have an overview of runtime tracing in Go, so that you can start exploring the behavior of your own programs.*
